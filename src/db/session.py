"""Single async psycopg connection pool for the ``coding_github`` database.

Copied from coding-containers ``src/db/session.py`` (coding-analysis' shape): raw
psycopg, one ``AsyncConnectionPool`` per process, opened lazily.

PgBouncer transaction-mode safety:
- ``prepare_threshold = None`` disables server-side prepared statements, which
  break under transaction pooling.
- Every statement runs in its own short transaction; nothing session-level is
  ever ``SET`` (it would leak to the next PgBouncer client).
