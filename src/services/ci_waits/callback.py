"""Completion callback for CI-checks waits (``wait_for_pr_checks``).

Same semantics as coding-containers ``services/exec_jobs/callback.py``
(feat/async-exec-callback), itself from coding-analysis #118
(``bug_hunter.callback_url_allowed`` / ``_send_completion_callback``), with the
setting renamed to ``CI_CALLBACK_URL_PREFIXES``:

* Allowlist, fail closed. No configured prefix refuses every ``callback_url``.
  The origin (scheme + host:port) must match a prefix EXACTLY and only the path
  is a prefix; after it the path must be plain segments (``_CALLBACK_TAIL``) —
  the traversal guard, because httpx collapses ``..`` before sending. No
  userinfo, no fragment, no whitespace/control characters, at most 2048 chars.
  Re-checked at send time, so narrowing the prefixes also stops pending waits.
* Delivery: one round of up to 3 attempts (2 s / 4 s backoff) per call; the
  response is classified by :func:`classify_response` against n8n 2.42.6's
  ``WaitingWebhooks.executeWebhook``. A round that ends retryable returns
  ``RETRY`` and the caller persists it (``ci_waits.callback_state = 'retrying'``
  with a capped ``callback_next_attempt_at``) for the sweeper to resend — indefinitely,
  never a give-up: a parked n8n cell has no other way to be resumed. Only a
  response proving no parked cell can still take it, or a misconfiguration, is
  final. No redirects followed. Never raises.
